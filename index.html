    <P>I never thought i'll ever have to take a choice to learn <a href="ffgfgf">programming</a>, I've always wanted to become an ethical hacker but I never knew my way around <em><strong>It seemed my life depended on learning how to create things out of imaginary thinking</strong></em>. It all happened that on the day before today which is yesterday, I stumbled on a particular post on <a href="hfggf">Twitter</a> and it was about some guy who claimed he has made millions from programming even when he had zero passion for programming.</P>
    <p>It now dawned on me that asides from passion it takes something we call <a href="hfhfyh">consistency</a> to make anything happen.  I knew it was time for me to now explore my dreams which i was getting closer to bit by bit. On this day, i'll be grabbing the bull by the horn as i bought a course on <a href="fgdd">Web Develpment</a>, and from today till the beginning of my learning, i'll give a detailed summary of what i've learnt in each day.</p><br>
